# Commentary:

# Usage: guile-snarf [-o OUTFILE] INFILE [CPP-OPTIONS ...]
#
# Process INFILE using the C pre-processor and some other programs.
# Write output to a file named OUTFILE or to the standard output when no
# OUTFILE has been specified or when OUTFILE is "-".  When writing
# to a file, ignore lines from the input matching the following grep(1)
# regular expression:
#
#       ^#include ".*OUTFILE"
#
# If there are errors during processing, delete OUTFILE and exit with
# non-zero status.
#
# During snarfing, the pre-processor macro @code{SCM_MAGIC_SNARFER} is
# defined.
#
# If env var CPP is set, use its value instead of the C pre-processor
# determined at Guile configure-time: "@CPP@".
